# AO3 Fanwork Statistics

This was created because I originally wanted to make some statistics regarding the Dragon Age tag on [archiveofourown.org](http://archiveofourown.org).

I created a script to go through the tag and save the data of every fanwork in the tag. The script also counts how often specific characters and ships were used, plus a few other interesting things.
It was also the first time I worked with d3 to create data graphics with the collected data.
The result can be seen [here](https://leats.github.io/DragonAgeStats/).
